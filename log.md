# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Repeated Basic HTML and a little Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** I remember almost all of Basic HTML. Not bad.

*Mark:*
+ main - for SEO; 
+ required in input - user will not be able to submit form until user filled them out;
+ same radio button shoud have same name atribute;
+ use atribute for on label and same id in input;

### Day 1: January 8,2019

**Today's Progress:** Repeated Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** I need more practice in variables and media query.

*Mark:*
+ [attr=value] to change style of elemen with specific atribute
+ em and rem - relative lenth units
+ !important to make style important
+ CSS variables 
+ media query
