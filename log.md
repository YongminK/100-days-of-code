*Mark:*
+ main - for SEO; 
+ required in input - user will not be able to submit form until user filled them out;

+ use atribute for on label and same id in input;

### Day 1: January 8,2019

**Today's Progress:** Repeated Basic CSS. Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** I need more practice in variables and media query. I have learned a lot of new things from section Applied Visual Design. 

*Mark:*
+ [attr=value] to change style of elemen with specific atribute
+ em and rem - relative lenth units
+ !important to make style important
+ CSS variables 
+ media query
+ tag *strong, em, u, s*
+ *hr* to make horizontal line
+ opacity - from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear
+ *box-shadow*
+ *text-transform* to make uppercase, lowercase and other
+  *font-weight* sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text
+ relative position doesn't remove element from the normal flow, other element round it still behave as if that item were in its default position
+ absolute position delete element from normal flow and lock it  in place relative to its parent container
+ fixed position locked element to the browser window
+ *float* remov element from the normal flow of a document and push it to either the left or right of their containing parent element. You can use it to make two column
+ *z-index* higher values covers 
+ *linear-gradient()* for *background* looks cool. Try to use it
+ *repeatin-linear-gradient()* too
+ you can use *transform: scale(..);* witj hover
+ you can skew element with *transform: skewX/skewY(..deg)*
+ i need practice with :before and :after
+ @keyframes - animation 
  + *cubic-bezier*
