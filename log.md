**Today's Progress**: Repeated Basic HTML and a little Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** I remember almost all of Basic HTML. Not bad.

*Mark:*
+ main - for SEO; 
+ required in input - user will not be able to submit form until user filled them out;

### Day 1: January 8,2019

**Today's Progress:** Repeated Basic CSS. Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** I need more practice in variables and media query. I have learned a lot of new things from section Applied Visual Design. 

*Mark:*
+ [attr=value] to change style of elemen with specific atribute
+ em and rem - relative lenth units
+ !important to make style important
+ CSS variables 
+ media query
+ tag *strong, em, u, s*
+ *hr* to make horizontal line
+ opacity - from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear
+ *box-shadow*
+ *text-transform* to make uppercase, lowercase and other
+  *font-weight* sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text
+ relative position doesn't remove element from the normal flow, other element round it still behave as if that item were in its default position
+ absolute position delete element from normal flow and lock it  in place relative to its parent container
+ fixed position locked element to the browser window
+ *float* remov element from the normal flow of a document and push it to either the left or right of their containing parent element. You can use it to make two column
+ *z-index* higher values covers 
+ *linear-gradient()* for *background* looks cool. Try to use it
+ *repeatin-linear-gradient()* too
+ you can use *transform: scale(..);* witj hover
+ you can skew element with *transform: skewX/skewY(..deg)*
+ i need practice with :before and :after
+ @keyframes - animation 
  + *cubic-bezier*
  
  ### Day 2: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** It was easy. I think it must on page to make easier life for people with some disableties.

*Mark:*
+  use *main* to wrap central information on your page
+ *<div>* - groups content
+ *<section>* - groups related content
+ *<article>* - groups independent, self-contained content
+ *audio* tag including *controls* for play, pause and others and *source* with *src* and *type* 
+ tag *figure* and *figcaption*
+ *label* atribute *for* associate that *label* with the form control. *for* must be the same with *id*
+ *fieldset* and *legend* to surround radio buttons
+ *input* with type *date*
+ *time datetime*
+ with CSS you can make content visible only to a screen reader
+ contrast ratio between background color  and text color must be 6:1
+*accesskey* *tabindex*
  
  ### Day 3: January 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design. CSS Flexbox

**Thoughts:** More practice with responsive WD plz. More.

*Mark:*
+ media query
+ max-width: 100%; height: auto;
+ retina image. Width and height are only half of what the original file 
+ Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a *device*, and percentages are relative to the size of the *parent container element*.
  +vw
  +vh
  +vmin
  +vmax
-------------------------
+ display: flex;
+ *flex-direction* row,column
+ https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg
+ *justify-content* center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between. It's for main axis
+ *align-items* flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline
+ *flex-wrap* Next item move into a new row or column. The break point of  wrapping happens - the size of the items and the size of the container.
+ *flex-shrink* 
+ opposite to preveous *flex-grow*
+ *flex-basis* to set initial size of an item
+ *flex* flex-grow:  flex-shrink:  flex-basis: 
+ Use the *order* Property to Rearrange Items
+ *flex-self* to adjust each item's alignment individually
+
